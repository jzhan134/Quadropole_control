The scripts should be ran with the following interfaces:
	1. LoadParameters - includes all parameters for device connection, image analysis, and OP calculation
	2. ConnectDevice - establish connection to function generator and camera. Only run once per reopen Matlab
	3. RemoveParticles - start the devices and control the particle number to 300
	4. SelfAssemblyControl - conduct the main body of the control.
Other files are supporting scripts/functions for the above interfaces
